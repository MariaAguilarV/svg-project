## SVG & CSS

DUE: Wednesday, Nov. 6, Noon.

This project is worth **fifteen (15) points.**


## Instructions

You selected flags from the list below in class.

Write svg code to "draw" each flag. Use CSS to apply the flag's colors. Submit three (3) flags from tier I, two (2) from tier II and one (1) from tier III.

The following conditions apply:

- Flags must reflect correct proportions and colors as specified on [flags.net](http://www.flags.net/). Make each flag at least 600 pixels wide.

- You may apply an `id` attribute to each `svg` element to identify the country, but you *may not* use `id` or `class` attributes for any elements within the svg.

  Example: `<svg id="united-states">...</svg>`

- Use an external style sheet to apply the colors for each flag. You may *only* use descendent, child, adjacent sibling, general sibling, pseudo-classes (i.e. `first-child`, `last-child`, etc.) or pseudo-elements as selectors.

- Included in this repository are assets -- `star.svg` and `crescent.svg`. You may use these if a flag you selected requires a five-pointed star and/or crescent. You will need to use css positioning to overlay these on top of the svg you draw. You may need to use the `transform` property to adjust these as well.


## Grading

Deductions will be applied for the following:

Two and a half (2.5) points are earned for each correctly completed flag.

Projects submitted past the due date will receive a zero (0).

- Submitting an unassigned flag
- Improper flag design, colors, proportions
- Use of `id` or `class` selectors (outside of the svg `id`)
- Styling of flags in svg

Use of a vector graphic tool (i.e. Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, etc.) to create any flags will be considered cheating. You will receive a zero (0) for the full assignment and further penalties as specified in the syllabus will apply.
